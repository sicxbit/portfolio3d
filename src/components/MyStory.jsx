                <p>Hi, I’m Arunjith! I have a diploma and degree in electronics engineering and a passion for learning and exploring new technologies.</p>

                <p>After completing my studies, I tried freelancing as a MERN stack developer. For two years, I worked on web development projects and learned a lot about coding and creative problem-solving. However, I decided to explore new directions when freelancing didn’t work out as planned.</p>

                <p>I then stepped into the electronics industry, joining a PCB manufacturing company. Currently, I work as an Engineer's Assistant at SFO Technologies by Nest. While my roles have not yet allowed me to apply my skills in electronics or data analysis, I remain eager to bring these abilities into future opportunities.</p>

                <p>To grow further, I earned a Google Data Analytics certification and built skills in Python for data analysis. These efforts have expanded my knowledge and opened up new possibilities for combining my technical and analytical expertise.</p>

                <p>I’ve also worked on personal projects, including building this website, an earlier portfolio, and several data analysis projects that showcase my learning journey.</p>

                <p>I’m now looking for opportunities where I can fully utilize my skills in electronics, data, and technology to make a meaningful impact.</p>

                <p>Let’s connect and create something</p>
